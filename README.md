# The Homework Container

This is a containerized repository for doing projects and homework in
C/C++/Python/Java. The organization for this is quite simple. The src
directory is where you would write and organize your code. The test
directory is where to write test programs to test your code. When
you compile your code, binaries can be placed in src/bin for access
from the test directory. For interpreted code, the src directory itself
is in the PYTHONPATH & CLASSPATH for access from the test directory.

If you are new to containers, then you will need to download Docker and
install it on your computer.

If you are running Windows, you'll also need to
enable the WSL 2 feature on Windows. You can read about how to do that by
going to this web address.

Once you have done that, clone this repository on your system. You may need to
install GIT to do that. Instructions can be found here. Otherwise, you can
download the zip file found under the Code dropdown menu on the github page.

Finally, you'll likely want to install Visual Studio Code. It makes using
containers very painless. Other environments are possible, but Studio Code
is recommended.
